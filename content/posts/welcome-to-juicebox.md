Our first blog, how exciting! Getting started, I want to preface what our content will be about and who we are and what we do at **Juicebox**.

## What is Juicebox?

Juicebox is an employee celebration platform that empowers team leaders and managers in celebrating their employees on productivity, team wins, outstanding attendance, or for any reason at all. Team members are what makes modern companies thrive, we should be celebrating our coworkers and employees every chance we get!

## How does it work?

Glad you asked! If you're a decision maker, you can [sign up here](getjuicebox.io/signup) to get started on your 7 day trial(_psst.... no credit card required_). If you're a member of team, let your manager know about us and we are happy to catch them up to speed.

The basics of Juicebox is pretty simple, the manager or organization admin can award any team members points and that team member can eventually redeem these points for custom rewards, set up by your manager, or our awesome catalog of gift cards, seriously we have over 70 options.

Check this out, members are allowed a monthly allowance for being awesome and they can even recognize a coworkers awesome deeds. We recommend 10 - 15 points starting out. These points renew every month on the first.

## Who's it for?

Juicebox is for any organization that has people volunteering, employed, or even communities that want to reward certain members points. We have use cases for companies, creators, gamers, and more.
